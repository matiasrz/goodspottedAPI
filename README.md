# FOOD FINDER #
Our purpose as food finder app is to make ease to find raw/base material to cook/bake dishes across a map view
marking the points where to buy.
All the data will be generated by other users. Also, products will be approved on a base of credibility measures

# Q&A
* Why the table/model productProspect doesn't have country & store as foreign key(FK)?
- We need to be able to receive thousands of request and it's faster not to have a defined relationship. Also the bussiness flow will check if the store/country exists with some API(Google Maps u other).
